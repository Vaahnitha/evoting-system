# Security Checklist for E-Voting System

This checklist ensures your E-Voting System deployment follows security best practices.

## üîê Environment Variables Security

### ‚úÖ Required Actions
- [ ] **Never commit `.env` files** - They are automatically ignored by `.gitignore`
- [ ] **Generate secure secret keys** using `python generate-secret-key.py`
- [ ] **Use different secret keys** for each environment (dev/staging/production)
- [ ] **Store all sensitive data** in environment variables, never in code
- [ ] **Regularly rotate secret keys** (especially in production)

### ‚úÖ Verification
- [ ] Check that `.env` files are not tracked by git: `git status` should not show `.env`
- [ ] Verify secret keys are not hardcoded in settings files
- [ ] Confirm all sensitive configuration uses environment variables

## üîí Production Security

### ‚úÖ Required Environment Variables
- [ ] `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` - Secure, randomly generated key
- [ ] `DEBUG=False` - Never use debug mode in production
- [ ] `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Strong password (12+ characters)
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - Secure database connection with SSL
- [ ] `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - Only your production domains
- [ ] `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Only your frontend domains

### ‚úÖ Security Settings
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for all production URLs
- [ ] Secure cookies enabled (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] SSL redirect enabled
- [ ] HSTS headers configured
- [ ] Database SSL required

### ‚úÖ Access Control
- [ ] Strong admin password (not default)
- [ ] Admin credentials not shared via insecure channels
- [ ] Regular password rotation policy
- [ ] Access logs monitoring

## üõ°Ô∏è Development Security

### ‚úÖ Development Environment
- [ ] Use development-specific secret keys (not production keys)
- [ ] Keep `DEBUG=True` only for local development
- [ ] Use strong passwords even in development
- [ ] Don't share `.env` files between team members
- [ ] Use separate databases for development and production

### ‚úÖ Code Security
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] All sensitive configuration via environment variables
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] SQL injection protection (Django ORM)
- [ ] XSS protection enabled

## üîç Security Monitoring

### ‚úÖ Regular Checks
- [ ] Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Check for failed login attempts
- [ ] Monitor database access patterns
- [ ] Review user permissions regularly
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated

### ‚úÖ Incident Response
- [ ] Have a plan for security incidents
- [ ] Know how to rotate credentials quickly
- [ ] Have backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Document security contacts

## üìã Deployment Security

### ‚úÖ Before Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables set correctly
- [ ] Secret keys generated and secure
- [ ] Database connections use SSL
- [ ] CORS settings restricted to frontend domains
- [ ] Debug mode disabled

### ‚úÖ After Deployment
- [ ] Test all functionality works
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is working
- [ ] Check admin access works
- [ ] Test voting functionality
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in logs

## üö® Security Red Flags

### ‚ùå Never Do These
- [ ] Commit `.env` files to version control
- [ ] Use production keys in development
- [ ] Leave default passwords in production
- [ ] Enable debug mode in production
- [ ] Use HTTP instead of HTTPS in production
- [ ] Share credentials via insecure channels
- [ ] Use weak or predictable secret keys

## üîß Security Tools

### Available Scripts
- `generate-secret-key.py` - Generate secure Django secret keys
- `setup-local-env.bat/.sh` - Secure local environment setup

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check if .env is ignored
git status

# Test secret key generation
python generate-secret-key.py

# Verify environment variables
python -c "import os; print('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY set:', bool(os.getenv('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')))"

# Check database connection
python backend/manage.py dbshell
```

## üìû Security Contacts

In case of security issues:
1. **Immediate**: Rotate all credentials and secret keys
2. **Document**: Record what happened and when
3. **Notify**: Inform relevant stakeholders
4. **Fix**: Address the root cause
5. **Prevent**: Update procedures to prevent recurrence

---

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regularly review and update your security practices.
